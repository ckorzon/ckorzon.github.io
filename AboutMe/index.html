            <p>
                Hi! My name is Conrad, welcome to my site. I'm currently an undergraduate Computer Science major at
                the University of Connecticut. Moving forward, I plan to focus on software development, but I have
                an interest an all areas of Computer Science and as such I currently work part time as a Student 
                Web Developer at UConn's University Communications office. I love both my classes and my work,
                as even though it has all kept me quite busy, I've learned more in the past few years than I had ever
                imagined I would. Here's a list of some of the topics I've worked with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Object oriented programming</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Recursion</li>
                <li>HTML, CSS, SCSS</li>
                <li>Javascript ('vanilla', Angular, jQuery)</li>
                <li>Runtime analysis</li>
                <li>Algorithms</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="alternateFont">Some fun facts:</h4>
            <p>
                I was born in Connecticut and have lived here my whole life. I graduated from 
                Coginchaug Regional Highschool, in Durham CT, in 2017. Our towns, Middlefield and Durham,
                are so small that our graduating class only had about 140 students. My first experience in
                programming was during my junior year at Coginchaug when the school began offering an introductory
                class in Python. After completing the course I went on to help teach it the following semester, which
                is when I decided on Computer Science as my major.

            <h2 class="alternateFont">About This Site</h2>
            <p>
                I've made this website with a few goals in mind: to practice some of what I've learned
                while working in web development, to keep record of other topics I've worked on in my 
                academics and elsewhere, and to serve as a source of information about myself which may 
                be a bit more interesting than my resum&#233; or linkedin.
