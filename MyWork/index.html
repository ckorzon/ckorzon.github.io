            <h2>Professional</h2>
            <p>
                I feel lucky that I've had a chance to work on such exciting projects and with such knowledgeable and experienced individuals in my career so far. Here is a 
                quick rundown of projects I've worked on and experience I've gained so far:
            </p>
            <h3>Travelers</h3>
            <p>
                My internship with Travelers Insurance's eBusiness department was my first chance to work in computer science, and more specifically my work there focused on
                web application development. This was a great learning experience for me, I was able to work on team projects involving an online billing application, as well
                as an inclement-weather alerting application. Within these efforts I was able to learn HTML, Javascript, Angular 6, CSS/SCSS, Test-Driven Development, 
                Agile Methodology, and much more.
            </p>
            <h3>UConn - University Communications</h3>
            <p>
                I've worked part time as a student web developer for University Communications at UConn for a little over a year now and it's been a fantastic learning and 
                development experience. I've been able to expand upon my knowledge of web development, working with tools such as Wordpress, PHP, Docker, and more. Working here
                has also helped me understand the importance of accessibilty in web development and some of the best approaches to developing sites to accommodate all users. 
                Some of the projects I've worked on here include an Economic Impact webpage, a Commencement site for a graduating class, and various search enhancement features across
                several of the University's webpages. 
            </p>
            <h3>Lockheed Martin</h3>
            <p>
                During the summers of 2019 and 2020 I've had the pleasure of working for Lockheed Martin's IT department within the RMS business area - specifically at Sikorsky
                in Stratford, Connecticut. Working for Lockheed Martin has been an amazingly educational and fulfilling opportunity which has allowed me to branch out to other areas
                within computer science. Some of these areas which I had a chance to get exposure to include IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things), Application Monitoring - including 
                the health and use levels of application servers, and various forms of Data Reporting.
